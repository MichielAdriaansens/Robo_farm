~Zeltron "It gets to a point where when he walks by my cell, rather than just walk by he would like to stop and make little slick comments.
"W'chu got goin in there, whatchu doin in there today".
I'm being locked up bish what's it look like i'm doin. 
C'mon man go on somewhere, i ain't got time to play. I ain't one of your great great grand chilren like get yo ass on man.

"Uhuu i'll be back, don't worry about it".
